## About Me


![Profile Picture]({{ "assets/images/profile-pic.jpg" | relative_url }}){: class="profile-image"}

 
My name is {{ site.name }}, and I am studying mechanical engineering with a strong interest in aerospace and mechanical design. My experience spans engineering internships, project team leadership, and the integration of hardware and software into complete systems. I have designed and validated mechanical components using CAD modeling, modal and structural analysis, and physical testing. On my project team, I lead control-surface design and wing load-testing efforts, and I have also developed a vibration test fixture and contributed to the integration of an autonomous electric vehicle charging system. Beyond mechanical design, I have programming experience that allows me to approach engineering challenges from both mechanical and software perspectives. I am driven by innovation and enjoy working in dynamic, collaborative environments where I can contribute to systems with meaningful impact.
